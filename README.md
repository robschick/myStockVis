myStockVis
==========
Is a decent first Shiny app. The goal of the app is to allow a user to select a stock using an input stock ticker box, and have the closing prices displayed as a line chart. The user can change the online source they want, as well as the date range. 

The user can also choose to display the 2008 financial crisis on top of the stock time series. 

Finally, beneath the main plot output, the user can see the % change in the stock over the time period. This is calculated dynamically.
